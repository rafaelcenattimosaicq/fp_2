/**
 * @brief This class represents a reconfiguration marker that passes through currently deployed versions of decomposed query plans
 * and transforms them. To this end, a reconfiguration marker contains a collection of instructions for different decomposed
 * query plans to allow the transformation. This information is wrapped together in a map.
 *
 * The following information is provided within a reconfiguration marker:
 *
 * Key (Who): represents identity of the decomposed query plan that needs to react upon receiving the reconfiguration marker.
 *            The key is composed of WorkerId, SharedQueryId, and DecomposedQueryId.
 *
 * State (What): represents what need to be done upon receiving the reconfiguration marker. Currently we support: (1.) Draining
 * a decomposed plan (terminate a plan), (2.) Updating a decomposed plan (plan mutation), and (3.) Updating and then draining a
 * decomposed plan (plan termination post state migration).
 *
 * Reconfiguration Metadata (How): represent necessary information on how to perform the reconfiguration.
 *
 * The "What" and "How" are represented together as ReconfigurationMarkerEvent.
